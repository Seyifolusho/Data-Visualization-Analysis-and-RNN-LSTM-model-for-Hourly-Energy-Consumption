# Hourly Energy Consumption Forecasting Using RNN LSTM 
 

## **Introduction**  
As someone passionate about leveraging data science for impactful solutions, I developed this project to analyze hourly energy consumption data. The goal was to uncover patterns, identify trends, and forecast future energy needs using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Energy consumption data plays a critical role in helping utilities and policymakers optimize grid operations, manage costs, and effectively integrate renewable energy sources.

## **Problem Statement**  
Forecasting energy consumption is vital for efficient grid management and planning. Through this project, I aimed to address the following challenges:  
- Understanding historical energy consumption trends.  
- Identifying seasonal patterns and anomalies in energy usage.  
- Building a robust forecasting model capable of predicting future energy needs.  
- Applying clustering techniques to classify and understand different energy consumption behaviors.  

By tackling these challenges, I sought to provide actionable insights that could enhance grid efficiency and inform energy policies.

## **Dataset**  
The analysis was based on the **AEP_hourly.csv** dataset, which contains hourly energy consumption data. Key features include:  
- **Datetime:** Timestamp for each observation.  
- **AEP_MW:** Energy consumption in megawatts (MW).  

This dataset served as the foundation for understanding patterns and building a predictive model.

## **Data Preprocessing**  
Preparing the data for analysis and modeling was a critical step in this project. Key preprocessing tasks included:  

### **Datetime Handling**  
- Converted the "Datetime" column into a proper datetime object.  
- Extracted features such as year, month, day, and hour for granular analysis.  

### **Resampling**  
- Aggregated hourly data into daily averages to analyze broader trends.  

### **Data Splitting**  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.  
- Normalized the data using MinMaxScaler to ensure compatibility with the LSTM model.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
EDA was performed to gain deeper insights into energy consumption patterns:  

### **Visualizing Trends**  
- Yearly energy consumption trends revealed distinct seasonal variations, with higher usage during specific months.  
- Distribution plots illustrated the central tendency and variability in energy usage.  

### **Energy vs. Time**  
- Line plots highlighted the relationship between energy usage and time, clearly showing peak and off-peak hours.  

### **Clustering Analysis**  
- Applied K-Means clustering to categorize energy consumption patterns.  
- Identified distinct clusters, offering valuable insights into consumer behaviors.

#### **Model Design**  
Built an RNN with the following architecture:  
- LSTM layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.  
- Dense output layer for regression to predict energy consumption.  
- Optimized using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.  

#### **Training**  
- Trained the model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.  

### **Prediction and Evaluation**  
- Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset.  
- Visualized predicted values against actual observations to assess accuracy.
